The plaintiff was [Name der Klägerin GmbH], the exclusive German distributor for the fashion brand "Y". The defendant was [Name der Beklagten GmbH], part of the Bestseller group. The lawsuit was successful for the plaintiff ("Die Klage hat Erfolg"), meaning the court ruled in their favor.
The dispute is about the jeans models "P78A", "P68C", and "P82D" sold by the plaintiff under the brand "Y". According to the plaintiff and the court, their defining features are the unique combination of: V-shaped seams on the front of the legs, A non-concealed button fly, Two almost parallel curved seams on the front pockets, Back pockets made of three overlapping parts, Two rows of double seams on the back of the pants.
The defendant was ordered to do three main things: Provide the plaintiff with complete, written information about the extent to which it offered, advertised, or sold the infringing jeans, including lists of commercial buyers, sales quantities, sales prices, purchase prices, and full details on all advertising activities. Substantiate this information by providing all relevant documents, such as contracts, invoices, and receipts, organized as a formal accounting statement. The court also established that the defendant is liable for all past and future damages resulting from the infringement.
The plaintiff's claim was based on § 4 Nr. 3 a) UWG (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb) in conjunction with § 9 UWG and § 242 BGB. This law concerns unfair competition, specifically the act of offering an imitation of a competitor's product that causes an avoidable deception of consumers about its commercial origin.
The defendant's main arguments were: Denying the plaintiff's legal standing as the exclusive distributor. Challenging the "competitive distinctiveness" (wettbewerbliche Eigenart) of the plaintiff's jeans, arguing the design elements were common. Arguing that their own jeans were sufficiently different, creating a different overall impression. Claiming that the plaintiff's request for information had already been fulfilled before the lawsuit. Raising the statute of limitations defense (Einrede der Verjährung).
The court acknowledged that individual design elements might be used by other manufacturers. However, it ruled that the specific combination of all these features in one product gave the plaintiff's jeans their competitive distinctiveness. It stated that none of the examples provided by the defendant (in Anlage B 3) showed this same combination, and therefore they were not sufficient to weaken the unique character of the plaintiff's jeans.
The plaintiff submitted excerpts of their exclusive distribution agreements with the manufacturer, X S.p.A., for the years 2012-2024. These were filed as Anlagen K 25 – K 27. This was done in response to a formal notice from the court (Hinweis der Kammer) after the defendant had challenged their legal standing.
The first documented action was the Warning Letter (Abmahnung) sent to Amazon EU S.à.r.l. on December 20, 2017. The outcome was that Amazon responded by providing the plaintiff with the name and address of the supplier, who was the defendant in this case.
The court rejected the defense because the statute of limitations was suspended ("gehemmt") during the periods the parties were in negotiation (§ 203 BGB). The court identified two distinct periods of negotiation (from Jan 31 to Apr 20, 2018, and again from Aug 2 to Sep 6, 2018), which together amounted to a suspension of 116 days. By adding these 116 days to the original deadline, the court concluded that the lawsuit, filed on October 24, 2018, was submitted within the valid timeframe.
After the main judgment, the plaintiff's lawyer files an application for a Cost Assessment Order (Kostenfestsetzungsbeschluss). In this separate proceeding, the court clerk (Rechtspfleger) calculates the exact statutory fees based on the case's official value (€35,000). The resulting order is a separate, legally enforceable title. If the defendant doesn't pay, the plaintiff can use this order to instruct a bailiff to collect the debt.
If the defendant fails to provide the information, the plaintiff can initiate enforcement proceedings under § 888 ZPO. This involves filing an application with the court to compel the action by imposing a coercive fine (Zwangsgeld). If the fine cannot be collected, the court can order coercive detention (Zwangshaft) against the defendant's legal representative (i.e., the managing director) to force compliance.
